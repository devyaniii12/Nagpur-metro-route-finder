# ðŸš‡ Nagpur Metro Route Finder using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

In this project, I created a Java-based application to simulate the **Nagpur Metro route navigation system**.  
It finds the **shortest path between metro stations** using **Graph Data Structures** and **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**, with a custom **Heap (Priority Queue)** implementation.  
**Note:** The project uses dummy values for distances and travel times for demonstration purposes only and do not reflect actual metro data.

## âœ¨ Features
- Display all available **Nagpur metro stations**.
- Find the **shortest route** between any two stations.
- Show the **total distance** covered.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java  
- **Data Structures**: Graphs, Priority Queue (Heap)  
- **Algorithm**: Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
